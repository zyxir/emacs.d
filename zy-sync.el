;;; zy-sync.el --- Configuration synchronization. -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:

;; This file acts as a script to synchronize the configuration, which means to
;; install all packages required and re-compile all modified files, so that all
;; modifications take effect.

;;; Code:

;; Always load the newer source code to prevent inconsistency.

The greater the number is, the more thourough the synchronization
will be, and the more time it will also take.

If `zy-sync-level' is 0, only install missing packages and
re-compile outdated files. However, if any file of Zylib is
updated, all module files will be re-compiled to prevent
incompatibility.

If `zy-sync-level' is 1, only install missing packages, but
re-compile every file (all byte code is cleaned before
re-compilation).

If `zy-sync-level' is 2, re-install every package (excluding
built-in ones and external ones), and re-compile every file.

The value is obtained via the environment variable
\"ZYEMACS_SYNC_LEVEL\". If it is not an integer, or if it is an
integer lesser than 0, it is treated as 0; if it is an integer
greater than the greatest possible value, it is treated as the
greatest possible value.")
