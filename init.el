If FILE is a relative path, interpret it as a path relative to
the \"lisp\" directory in `user-emacs-directory', without suffix.
The suffix \".elc\" is always appended to FILE, meaning that
always try to load the byte code regardless of whether it exists.

If FILE is a absolute path, load it directly. This is the only
case where the file is loaded as is, without a guessed or
appended suffix. This case is reserved for loading the custom
file.

If FILE is a symbol whose name starts with the plus sign, like
`+leader', interpret it as a module of this configuration, and
load it accordingly. Always load a module's byte code.

If any error occur during loading, the error is captured and
reported, therefore the remaining loading keeps going on.
