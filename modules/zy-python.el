;;; zy-python.el --- Python development. -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides the `+python' module of the configuration.

;; Python is a very popular language, and Emacs has decent built-in support for
;; it. This file simply rebinds some of the keys and wrap some features to make
;; them more smooth.

;;; Code:

(require 'zylib)

(pkg! 'python-black)

(after! 'python
  ;; Fill docstring with according to PEP-257.
  (setq python-fill-docstring-style 'pep-257-nn)

  ;; No additional indentation for def blocks, like Black does.
  (setq python-indent-def-block-scale 1)

  ;; Set the compile command to executing the file itself in the project root.
  (add-hook! 'python-base-mode-hook

        (setq-local compile-command (format "python %s" buffer-file-name))

        ;; we want to use another command, use a prefix argument.
